# Backspace ðŸ”¥

**we built some cool AI stuff and it actually works (shocking, we know)**

---

## what even is this?

yo, we're just a bunch of college kids who got tired of existing AI tools being mid, so we built our own. backspace is basically a collection of AI tools that we use for our projects and figured other people might want too.

spoiler alert: it's actually pretty fire ðŸš€

## the goods

### AI stuff that doesn't suck
- **data processing that's not braindead** - our AI actually understands your data instead of just pretending to
- **content generation** - writes better than most of our professors (not a high bar but still)
- **decision making AI** - helps you make choices when your brain is fried from too much caffeine
- **text analysis** - figures out what people actually mean in their messages
- **smart automation** - handles the boring stuff so you don't have to
- **custom model training** - because one size fits none

## why we built this

honestly? we got tired of:
- paying enterprise prices for AI tools that hallucinate more than they help
- "intelligent" systems that are about as smart as a brick
- having to train models from scratch for every single project
- AI APIs that cost more than our tuition
- tools that promise the world but deliver a powerpoint

so we said "bet" and built our own.

## getting started (it's easier than calculus)

### you'll need:
- node.js (anything after 16, we're not picky)
- python 3.8+ if you're into that
- a browser that's not internet explorer
- coffee (optional but recommended)

### setup speedrun:
```bash
# yoink the code
git clone https://github.com/backspace/poi-suite.git

# install the things
npm install
# or if you're team python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# copy the config file and add your keys
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env (don't commit your keys, we will roast you)

# run it
npm start
# or
python app.py
```

## docs (for when you inevitably break something)

we actually wrote documentation because we're not monsters:
- [how to not mess up auth](docs/authentication.md)
- [AI tools that won't disappoint you](docs/ai-api.md)
- [model training guide](docs/model-training.md)
- [integration examples](docs/examples.md)

## supported stuff

### wallets we vibe with:
metamask, walletconnect, coinbase wallet, trust wallet, ledger, trezor (basically everything except the sketchy ones)

### payment methods:
cards, bank transfers, digital wallets, crypto, BNPL, pretty much anything except monopoly money

### analytics:
google analytics, our custom tracking, e-commerce platforms, CRM systems, your mom's spreadsheet

## what people use this for

- **online stores** - handling payments without wanting to throw your laptop
- **defi apps** - wallet integration that doesn't make users cry
- **content sites** - AI content + user tracking that's not creepy
- **saas apps** - subscription handling and analytics
- **random startup ideas** - whatever weird thing you're building at 2am

## security (we're not complete noobs)

- everything's encrypted (we watch too much mr. robot)
- GDPR compliant (europe made us do it)
- regular security audits (we pay actual professionals)
- 2FA support (please use it)
- role permissions (not everyone needs admin access, kevin)

## contributing (pls help us)

found a bug? have an idea? want to add something cool? slide into our DMs (or make a PR):

```bash
# fork it
# clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poi-suite.git

# make a branch
git checkout -b feature/something-cool

# do your thing
# commit with a message that makes sense
git commit -m "fixed the thing that was broken"

# send it
git push origin feature/something-cool
```

## get help (when things go wrong)

- **docs**: docs.backspace.io (actually updated, we promise)
- **discord**: [join the chaos](https://discord.gg/backspace)
- **email**: support@backspace.io (we check this sometimes)
- **github issues**: for when you want to publicly shame our bugs

## roadmap (what we're cooking)

### soonâ„¢
- [ ] even better AI models (because ours are already pretty good)
- [ ] more blockchain support (gotta catch 'em all)
- [ ] fraud detection that's actually smart

### eventually
- [ ] mobile SDK (for the phone people)
- [ ] AI model marketplace (stonks)
- [ ] enterprise stuff (for when we sell out)

### someday maybe
- [ ] world domination
- [ ] time travel integration
- [ ] AI that does our homework

## license

MIT license because we're not evil. do whatever you want with it, just don't blame us if it breaks your computer.
